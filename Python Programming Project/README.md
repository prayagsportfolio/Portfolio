# Code Breakers (Mastermind Clone)

## 📌 Project Overview
"Code Breakers" is a Python-based command-line implementation of the classic strategy game **Mastermind**. The objective is to guess a secret code generated by the computer within a limited number of attempts, using logic and deductive reasoning.

## 🎮 Game Features
* **Algorithm Logic:** Implemented the core logic to evaluate guesses, providing feedback via "Red Pins" (correct digit, correct spot) and "White Pins" (correct digit, wrong spot).
* **Persistence (File I/O):** Features a **Save & Load** system, allowing users to save their current game state to a file and resume it later.
* **Dynamic Difficulty:** The game generates random codes of varying lengths (4-6 digits) using the `random` module.
* **Input Validation:** Robust error handling to ensure user inputs are valid (correct length and digit range).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3
* **Concepts:** Conditionals, Loops, Lists, File Handling, Randomization.

## 🚀 How to Play
1. Run the script: `python code_breakers_bhatt59.py`
2. Select **New Game** from the menu.
3. Enter your guess (digits 0-5).
4. Use the feedback (Red/White pins) to deduce the correct code before you run out of turns!
