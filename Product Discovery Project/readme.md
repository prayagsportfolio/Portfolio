# FieldSmARt: Augmented Reality (AR) Gardening Assistant

## 📌 Project Overview
**FieldSmARt** is a conceptual design for an **Augmented Reality (AR)** mobile application aimed at modernizing gardening and farming. The project addresses "Tech Stress" by providing an intuitive, immersive interface that helps users diagnose plant health, identify pests, and manage equipment simply by scanning them with a smartphone.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **AR Diagnostic Scanning:** Users can scan plants to instantly detect diseases, pests, or nutrient deficiencies, receiving real-time tailored solutions.
* **Smart Equipment Recognition:** Scans gardening tools to provide usage instructions and maintenance tips, reducing the learning curve for beginners.
* **Stress-Free UI:** Designed using **Visceral Design** and **Conceptual Models** to minimize cognitive load and make technology accessible to non-tech-savvy users.

## 🔍 Research & Methodology
* **User Research:** Conducted surveys and persona development to identify key barriers to adopting ag-tech.
* **Competitive Analysis:** Evaluated existing solutions (CropX, Gardena, PlantSnap) to identify market gaps in user experience.
* **HCI Principles:** Applied Human-Computer Interaction standards to ensure the interface is intuitive and emotionally engaging.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools
* **Core Skills:** Product Design, UX/UI Research, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Market Analysis.
* **Concepts:** Augmented Reality (AR), Human Factors, Tech Stress Mitigation.
