## 📝 Project Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb property data to identify sales trends, optimal pricing strategies, and high-demand locations. The dashboard is designed to assist property investors and hosts in making data-driven decisions to maximize revenue.

### ❓ Business Problem
Property investors often struggle to determine the best locations to buy and how to price their listings effectively. This dashboard aims to answer:
* **Location Analysis:** Which neighborhoods or zip codes generate the highest revenue?
* **Pricing Strategy:** How does the number of bedrooms or room type correlate with listing price?
* **Seasonality:** What are the peak times of year for sales/bookings?

## 🗝️ Key Features & Insights
* **Geospatial Analysis:** Interactive map visualizing average price and sales volume by zip code/neighborhood.
* **Revenue Trends:** Time-series analysis showing sales performance over the year to identify seasonal spikes.
* **Product Segmentation:** Breakdown of sales by property type (Entire Home vs. Private Room) and bedroom count.
* **Interactive Filtering:** Users can drill down by specific time periods, room types, or locations to get granular insights.
