# Product Portfolio Optimization via Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
As a **Corporate Consultant** for **Griffith Foods**, I developed a Machine Learning solution to optimize product lines and reduce manufacturing complexity. The project focused on analyzing recipe and ingredient data to identify overlaps, enabling the company to standardize formulations and leverage economies of scale.

## 🔍 Methodology & Approach
* **Hierarchical Clustering:** Selected over K-Means and DBSCAN to generate **Dendrograms**, allowing stakeholders to visually identify recipe similarities without pre-defining cluster numbers.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Implemented **Tokenization** to break down text-based ingredient descriptions (e.g., "Green Apple" vs. "Red Apple"), converting them into numerical tokens for analysis.
* **Data Simulation:** Utilized simulated datasets to validate the model's ability to group unique recipes based on ingredient weights and formulation descriptions.

## 📊 Business Impact
* **Operational Efficiency:** Reduced changeover costs by identifying similar recipes that can be produced sequentially.
* **Capital Optimization:** Simplified the product line to reduce inventory complexity and capital expenditure.
* **Scalability:** Built a framework that allows the Research & Development team to search and compare formulas efficiently.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Algorithms:** Hierarchical Clustering, NLP (Tokenization).
* **Tools:** Python (Scikit-learn, Scipy), PowerPoint for Stakeholder Presentation.

## 📂 Project Structure
* **Project Presentation:** Detailed slide deck covering the problem statement, clustering methodology, and business impact (see attached `.pptx` file).
